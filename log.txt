UI Enhancements:
Registration & Login Screens:
Added a “Register” button to the login screen and a corresponding registration screen that mirrors the login UI.
Implemented smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions between the screens to provide a polished user experience.
Custom Exit Button:
Added a custom exit ("X") button on both screens to allow users to close the application gracefully.

Database Integration & Functionality:
User Registration & Authentication:
Integrated database operations for registration and login using PostgreSQL.
Modified the registerUser method to use Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS so that the generated user ID can be captured and stored in the User model.
Updated the authenticateUser method to return the user’s ID (or -1 on failure), which allows the creation of a complete User model upon login.
Database Initialization:
Ensured that the database schema is set up by using a DatabaseInitializer that creates tables if they don’t exist.
Confirmed that existing data is preserved and that the initializer runs at application startup.

Transaction Model & Controller:
Updated the Transaction model to include constructors for both manual creation and database retrieval.
Modified the transactions controller to retrieve transactions from the database, returning them as a list ordered by date in descending order.
User Model Update:
Updated the User model to include an ID field and a full constructor so that user data retrieved from the database can be fully captured.


Jiwon
- Had an issue with database
  - Felt the need of having the shared database as if someone committed, then it changes the database implementation setting. If we had a sharing one, we would have less chance of crashing database
  - Took 4 hours to figure out why mySQL did not work properly and found that it was because my laptop did not have a port. Solved the issue by initializing the port. 
  - Started to work on my part, which was about reading CSV files. Time spent about an hour.


Peyton
- Created new branch Peyton from main branch
- Added analyticsController class to handle the analytics data
- Added AnalyticsUI class to display the charts for the analytics
- For charts bar chart of income vs expenses, pie chart of income vs expenses and expenses by category, line chart of savings over time
- Changed savings over time and income vs expenses methods in AnalyticsUi to display time in chronological order 
- Ui opens in a different window still have to add it to the analytics tab in app
- Took around 4 hours to implement 


Andy
- Continued creating Integration tests for the database
- Worked on implementing the transaction log from Iteration 1 to the new UI
- Continued creating unit tests for the different modules and components that we already had 
- Worked on fixing bugs that prevented the program from starting up
- Time spent was around 3 hours

User Interface Enhancements:
Added a registration screen that mirrors the login UI.
Integrated smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions between the login and registration pages.
Added custom exit buttons to both screens to provide a consistent look and allow users to exit the application.
Implemented tooltips and enhanced error messages on login and registration pages to guide the user on expected input formats (e.g., email format, password length).

Database Integration and Improvements:
Created a DatabaseInitializer to set up the schema (tables for users and transactions) at application startup.
Refactored DatabaseManager to return a new connection for each operation, preventing the "connection has been closed" error.
Modified the registration method (registerUser) to return the generated user ID by using Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS.
Updated the login method (authenticateUser) to return the user’s ID (or -1 if authentication fails) for use in building a complete User model.

Controller and Model Updates:
Updated the Transaction model with a constructor to handle database retrieval (including conversion of SQL timestamps to LocalDate), and ensured that each transaction object carries its generated ID.
Enhanced the Transaction controller to:
Retrieve transactions in descending order by date.
Delete a specific transaction using its unique ID.
Updated the User model to include an ID field and a full constructor for database integration.
Maven Dependency Update:
Added the PostgreSQL JDBC dependency (org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.5) to the pom.xml file to support PostgreSQL database connectivity.
